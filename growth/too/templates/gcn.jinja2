{{oxford_commas(authors)}} report on behalf of the ZTF project and the GROWTH 
collaboration:
We observed the localization region of {{plan.event.gcn_notices[-1].stream}} 
trigger {{plan.dateobs}} UTC with {{plan.telescope}}. We obtained a series of 
{{oxford_commas(plan.plan_args.filt)}} band images covering 
{{ "%.1f"|format(plan.area) }} square degrees beginning at 
{{plan.validity_window_start}} ({{tdiff}} after the burst trigger time), 
corresponding to ~{{ "%.1f"|format(plan.get_probability(localization)) }}% 
of the probability enclosed in the localization region.
